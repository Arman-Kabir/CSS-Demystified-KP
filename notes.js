 * **The relationships between:
 * An element and the viewport
 * An element and it's parent
 * Sibling elements
 * 
 * **If the parent has a width and we declare a width to the child, it might overflow out the side or it might be a percentage of the parent's width.
 * 
 * *These relationships are controlled by a given elements formatting context.
 * 
 * **Layouts are all about Relationships between elements.
