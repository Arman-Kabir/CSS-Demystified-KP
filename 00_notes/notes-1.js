/**#8 Relationships
 * **The relationships between:
 * An element and the viewport
 * An element and it's parent
 * Sibling elements
 * 
 * **If the parent has a width and we declare a width to the child, it might overflow out the side or it might be a percentage of the parent's width.
 * 
 * *These relationships are controlled by a given elements formatting context.
 * 
 * **Layouts are all about Relationships between elements.

/**#11
 * ** When we declare a width to an element,  that width is setting the width of the content. 
 *  * Margin is spacing between elements
 */

/**#12
 *Block level elements have a width 100% by default..

 when we set width to % -- it't up the parent
 */

 /**13
  * as long as u don't have margin in border-box, u won't get overflow.

 /**15
  * every element has intrinsic height by default.
  * Means height is determined by content that is inside of it.

 /**16 Inheritance
  *  Inheritance is when we declare something on an element, and it also applies that element's descendants.
  * 
  * With CSS, there is only one parent
  * 
  * ** ANything related to Typography is inherited.
  * ** Nothing related to Layout is inherited
  * 
  * **Everything we see on the page is a child of the html element,so they inherit those properties.
